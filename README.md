# Functional-Programming
This is my repository for the Information Design: tech track, for the study Communication and Multimedia Design at the HvA.

# What did we do at the Tech Track?
The first goal was to learn how to use Functional Programming to clean op raw datasets filled in by students. Later on we are going to learn how to use D3, wich is a javascript library and framework used to create visualizations by combining data and graphical elements.
